Speech is the most powerful way of communication with which human beings express their thoughts and feelings through different languages. The features of speech differ with each language. However, even while communicating in the same language, the pace and the dialect varies with each person. This creates difficulty in understanding the conveyed message for some people. Sometimes lengthy speeches are also quite difficult to follow due to reasons such as different pronunciation, pace and so on.  So, a text summary would be an effective way to solve this problem. Also due to Covid 19 situation most of the lectures, meetings and webinars are conducted online. But most of the people donâ€™t find enough time to attend. Even if recorded videos are provided, it is not an efficient way due to lack of time. So, a summary in both audio and text format would be an effective way to solve this problem.
